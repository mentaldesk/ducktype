MentalDesk.DuckType
===================

This is a duck typing library for C#. The idea is that if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it's a duck.

In programming terms, that means if a class has all the members required to implement a particular interface, even if it doesn't explicitly implement that interface, then you can use it as if it does.
